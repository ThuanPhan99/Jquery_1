					<h3>Arc de Triomphe</h3>
					<h5>The Arc de Triomphe is one of the most famous monuments in Paris. </h5>
                     
                    <div class="expanding_panel" data-link-text="Read more">
                        <div class="expanding_panel_content_container">
                            <div class="expanding_panel_content">
                                <p>The monument stands in the centre of the Place Charles de Gaulle, at the western end of the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es. It should not be confused with a smaller arch, the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel, which stands west of the Louvre. The Arc de Triomphe honours those who fought and died for France in the French Revolutionary and the Napoleonic Wars, with the names of all French victories and generals inscribed on its inner and outer surfaces. Beneath its vault lies the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from World War I.</p>
                                <p>The Arc de Triomphe is the linchpin of the Axe historique (historic axis) &ndash; a sequence of monuments and grand thoroughfares on a route which runs from the courtyard of the Louvre to the Grande Arche de la D&eacute;fense. The monument was designed by Jean Chalgrin in 1806 and its iconographic program pits heroically nude French youths against bearded Germanic warriors in chain mail. It set the tone for public monuments with triumphant patriotic messages.</p>

					<h3>Eiffel Tower</h3>
					<h5>The Eiffel Tower is a wrought iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France.</h5>
    
                    <div class="expanding_panel" data-link-text="Learn more">
                        <p>The Tower is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. Constructed in 1889 as the entrance to the 1889 World&rsquo;s Fair, it was initially criticized by some of France&rsquo;s leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world. The Eiffel Tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world; 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015.</p>
                        <p>The tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become thetallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second-tallest structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.</p>

					<h3>Luxembourg Palace</h3>
					<h5>The Luxembourg Palace is located at 15 rue de Vaugirard in the 6th arrondissement of Paris.</h5>

                        <p>The Palace was originally built (1615&ndash;1645) to the designs of the French architect Salomon de Brosse to be the royal residence of the regent Marie de M&eacute;dicis, mother of Louis XIII of France. After the Revolution it was refashioned (1799&ndash;1805) by Jean Chalgrin into a legislative building and subsequently greatly enlarged and remodeled (1835&ndash;1856) by Alphonse de Gisors. Since 1958 it has been the seat of the French Senate of the Fifth Republic.</p>
